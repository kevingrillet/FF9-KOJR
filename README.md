# FF9-KOJR

## Story

Getting back to FF9 because FF7 RMK is out here, but I don't have PS4 :(

I'm still really bad at FF9 Jump Rope Minigame so I was looking for fun ideas on YouTube.
Found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9EJICJh6oQ with GitHub link https://github.com/mikelhamer/kojr .

Well, I don't have a RaspberryPi at home, but I have an Arduino.

Done some research on how to link an Arduino with a Solenoid: https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/solenoid-control-with-arduino.html

In the video he explains that he can't go over 700 so i think that the timing must need to be tweaked. So get back on GitHub i found this:  https://github.com/septomor/FF9-Jump-Rope-Script

Well, i hope that the timing is correct, now just need to wait and let's jump :)

## How to use it
- Prepare your electronic setup.
- Put everything in place.
- Place yourself in front of the little girl.
- Launch the program.
- Wait about 10 minutes.
